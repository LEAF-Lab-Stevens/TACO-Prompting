The caller's C reactive protein was 10.82 which is the highest it has ever been and the doctor said it was from her arthritis and allergies but she knows its not related to it. The caller read online that after 10 weeks of getting the first and second and booster dose the efficacy will go down to 35%. When can the caller get the booster shot? The caller mentioned that she had a dry cough fatigue and a scratchy throat. The caller took a PCR and rapid and it was negative. This all exacerbated her allergies. The caller had bad allergies and asthma and catches everything- a cold, the flu she catches everything. The caller has been tested for Covid 3 times because she had had 3 scares in the past 3 months. The caller's C reactive protein has never gone up 2 or 3. The caller didn't have these symptoms nowhere near the vaccine. The caller got sick. It went to an upper respiratory infection and the caller got an antibiotic and it helped.

Myoglobinuria. Did well with hydration. Renal functions stable. Incidental note of mild cough. Covid positive. See below discussion. Preferred home based care. See discussion. Home today.   Please see the following problem-list oriented Hospital Course below:  * Rhabdomyolysis Assessment & Plan  Likely secondary to his fall and being down to the evening and early morning hours.  He is also on a statin which will be held.  Will hydrate.  Recheck CK in a.m.  CK a bit higher, as expected, but renal function normal and low enough that the Rhabdo will not be likely to impact renal function. Renal function stable. Push fluids at home. Stop Statin. The patient and his wife feel that the Statin has actually been contributing to his muscular discomfort (prior to the fall) and they will take a holiday from taking it.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia Assessment & Plan  Denies recent hypoglycemia.  Was placed on a basal bolus regimen with glipizide on hold until further trends are available.  A1C 7.2  Remained on bolus insulin back-up given the D5 solution. One time use. Improved off of the solution.  Hypothyroidism Assessment & Plan  Reports multiple recent adjustments in his thyroid.  TSH was slightly low today though his free thyroxine level is 1.1.  Recheck in 6 weeks.  Dysphagia Assessment & Plan  See above.  Resolved, per patient report. No s/s during his time on the unit.  Oropharyngeal cancer Assessment & Plan  States he finished radiation therapy and chemotherapy summer of 2021. He does have a dry mouth and throat is result.  He does have a history of dysphagia as well but states this had improved to the point were no other dietary consistency adjustments were required.  He denies dysphagia to solids and liquids at present.  It is somewhat unclear why he has been falling forward.  His neurological exam seems relatively benign but will obtain CT head in a.m.  10/23 - CT head stable. F/u with PCP/Oncology. No evidence of recurrence.  COVID-19 Assessment & Plan  Mild cough of several days duration.  Wife was enquiring about Paxlovid. This is a possibility.  Will also check a film array.  Chest x-ray clear.  Recheck chest x-ray in a.m..  MDI as he has used this in the past.  We did discuss the outpatient process for obtaining Paxlovid and will attempt to assist with this should it be needed and should the patient be discharged tomorrow.   10/23 - Discussed Paxlovid with Pharmacist. Discussed indications and dosing. Cr Cl > 65, recent symptoms onset, meets criteria.   CXR with possible mild bibasilar infiltrates. O2 needs normal. Will discuss options with patient. He is at risk of other atypical infections. Film array pending. Add Azithromycin or Doxy.  Discussed with patient and wife in detail. Functional status back to normal. States he ""can do this at home"". Remarkably few symptoms and CXR findings subtle. He prefers to not stay for Remdesivir and we discussed that if the Covid screen had not been positive we may not have done a CXR with his mild symptoms. He does want to consider Paxlovid and I discussed this with the pharmacist at the patient's retail pharmacy to ensure the ability to procure. I've discussed circumstances in which he should call me or return to the hospital/ED. His Oxygen needs are stable. He has no dyspnea or fever.  Dehydration Assessment & Plan  Hydrate.  Recheck renal functions in a.m.  Improved.  Essential hypertension Assessment & Plan  Will check orthostatic blood pressure and pulse.  Follow-up.  Home meds reviewed.  - remained stable  Penicillin allergy Assessment & Plan  The patient does have a cough.  Unclear if this was related to the positive COVID test or other etiology.  A full film array will be obtained.  Chest x-ray clear.  No evidence of clear pneumonia or pulmonary infiltrates present.  Penicillin allergy noted in the event that antibiotics required.  Will provide Doxycycline on discharge. Hx of H/N Cancer and prior health-care exposures.                - reviewed guidelines on drug interactions and doxycycline was not on any of the list of anti-infectives of concern.                - he has no clinically significant hepatic dysfunction or insufficiency to require dose adjustment or concern. He will have repeat LFTs off of Crestor.

The patient's relevant medical history included: ""uncontrolled type II diabetes"" (ongoing); ""loss of taste"" (unspecified if ongoing); ""persistent cough"" (unspecified if ongoing). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  The following information was reported: DRUG INEFFECTIVE (hospitalization, medically significant) with onset Jan2022, outcome ""unknown"", COVID-19 (hospitalization, medically significant) with onset Jan2022, outcome ""recovered"" (2022) and all described as ""Delta/Omicron BA.1 coinfection/ previously vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer/ BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination almost a year prior"". The patient was hospitalized for drug ineffective, covid-19 (hospitalization duration: 3 day(s)). The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: Blood glucose: (Jan2022) hyperglycemic; Body temperature: (Jan2022) unknown results, notes: afebrile; SARS-CoV-2 test: (Jan2022) Delta/Omicron BA.1; Serology test: (Jan2022) unknown result. Therapeutic measures were not taken as a result of drug ineffective, covid-19.  Clinical course: An additional Delta/Omicron BA.1 coinfection in a 70-year-old female with uncontrolled type II diabetes. This case was notable as it occurred overlapped temporally with the coinfection at the beginning of January 2022 when both the Delta and Omicron BA.1 VOCs were present in the community in relative abundance. Upon presentation the patient was afebrile but complained of a loss of taste and persistent cough. The patient was previously vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer/ BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination almost a year prior, but her serological status was unknown. At the time of presentation, the patient was profoundly hyperglycemic which can impact immune function. Type II diabetes is a risk factor for more severe COVID-19. Thus, while not having underlying malignancy or managed with immunosuppressive drugs as others in this case series, this patient's immune status was likely dysregulated due to her comorbidity which can render her more susceptible to infection. This patient was managed without COVID-19 specific therapy and discharged 3 days later. As before, no mutational signatures consistent with SARS-CoV-2 recombination were identified in this patient's respiratory specimens.  The lot number for BNT162b2 was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender's Comments: The vaccine efficacy varies from one patient to another and can be affected by different factors; however, a contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to its Lack of efficacy cannot be ruled out.

138,"HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of intellectual disability and developmental delay, uncontrolled diabetes not on any medications with A1c 11.5, presenting to the hospital for weakness.   Hospital course:   In the emergency room the patient was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic with elevated WBC, dimer, sodium to 159, glucose to 742 with elevated creatinine and lactate.  Suspected HHS, started on insulin and dextrose.  Patient was found to be COVID-positive 1/11/2022.  Right middle lobe infiltrate seen on imaging, CT scan of the chest, started on antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia.  Patient was not hypoxic.   Patient was initially admitted to the ICU on insulin drip, blood sugars quickly improved.  Patient did not have good oral intake throughout the early portion of her hospitalization and was resistant to taking oral intake despite return to her baseline level mental status.  Speech pathology consulted.  Electrolytes and renal function slowly returned back to normal on D5W drip.  Patient had elevated dimer but CT scan of the chest and lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds were negative for VTE.  Continued on standard dose DVT prophylaxis with enoxaparin.   By 1/17 she had continued stability and remained at her baseline mental status. She continued to deny food and PO intake. It is thought that her poor PO intake was behavioral with maybe some contribution from lack of taste 2/2 COVID.  SLP was unable to work w/ patient due to refusal of eating/drinking or participating with their assessment.  She also does not have cognitive capacity to participate in exam and explain why she is refusing to eat. This was discussed with her sisteer who is primary caregiver. She expressed pt likes specific foods and can refuse things if she doesn't want it.  Again thought her PO intake was behavioral. Due to this, the best plan for improving her PO intake was determined to be getting back home to a familiar setting with her sister and foods she likes.  Discussed this with her sister who was in agreement and excited to have her sister come home. Plans were for DC on 1/19 evening, however family called later in the evening and reported they could not provide support / cares until the morning as they were making arrangements. Pt DC on 1/20/22   For more detail, please see admission H&P.  Hospital course dictated by problem:     Suspected HHS Hypernatremia Hyperkalemia, hypokalemia Dehydration Acute Kidney Injury/Acute Renal Failure As above. Lytes normalized and AKI resolved.     Chronic type 2 diabetes with acute hyperglycemia, A1c 11.5 Poor oral intake As above, poor intake thought to be behavioral and best mgmt plan is to return home to familiar environment and foods she enjoys.  PTA on metformin 1000mg BID. Per family sugars are not as controlled as they would like but they have found a good balance with this as the patient does not tolerate insulin very well (injection). Per family pt has enough metformin at home and no refills needed.

She was sent to the hospital from her Rheumatologist's office, Dr., during a visit for a second dose of rituximab; he and staff advised she present to the emergency department after report of ongoing fever at which point she was admitted.   She carries dx of complex tracheal stenosis (hx dilation w/ mitomycin and Kenalog) and microscopic polyangiitis, ANCA-associated vasculitis, for which she has been working with Rheumatology, Dr., and taking Imuran, recent steroid, and recent first dose of Rituximab. She arrived taking oral estrogen for menopausal symptoms.   Fever persisted for most of her stay, typically in the early morning hours around 4-6 AM with her last recorded fever at 12/26/21 AM, the day prior to discharge.  Her shortness of breath was mild, O2 saturations remained at 90 and above, and supplemental oxygen was never used but her CXR w/ mild pulmonary infiltrates were noted a negative nasal swab source for Covid PCR, but was positive on BAL from bronchoscopy 12/23/21. No diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) was confirmed by bronch so infiltrates were though possibly due to Covid pneumonia. She was given prednisone 20 mg daily, an increase from recent start of 15 mg daily for her vasculitis.   Symptom start of most current fever and sense of illness was 12/19/21 based on her calendar, and was distinct from prior once monthly fevers since summer 2021.  Pulmonology recommended monoclonal antibody which was arranged 12/25/21. ID weighed in and did not express confidence infection was the reason for fevers over past 6 mos, that it is possible recent sx are from Covid infection. It was recommended: o she have COVID-19 antibody levels collected in approximately 3 months to determine if she developed nuclear capsid antibodies following this infection. o She should receive at least 1 booster vaccine, preferably mRNA vaccine either Pfizer or Moderna.  She will need to wait at least 90 days after her monoclonal antibody infusion before booster vaccine can be given. o If she does not develop antibodies following her current infection, she may be a candidate for prophylactic monoclonal antibody administration.  Her immunologist can contact the Infectious Disease office or the monoclonal antibody infusion clinic at that time to determine if there are any clinical trials that would be beneficial for this patient. These recommendations were provided in writing in her DC material for her reference. Dr., her Rheumatologist, then weighed in and recommended continued HOLD on Imuran at discharge and wanted her to be, 1) 2-3 weeks out from antibiotic treatment for possible bacterial pneumonia, and 2) feeling well.   CRP was high on admission and it was not clear if this was a useful measure in the setting of chronic inflammation.   Rocephin and azithro empiric for CAP to be completed orally if discharged  CAP tx was completed in hospital but her probability of bacterial pneumonia was in question.  Leukopenia resolved during her stay, with hold on Imuran, despite Covid infection, etc. Bactrim PJP ppx, Hydroxychloroquine, Valtrex, Lyrica and PPI continued   Hot flashes from acute-onset menopause due to HOLD on oral estrogen in setting of Covid infection (indication to avoid adding to any hypercoagulable state from Covid infection).  She was able to tell the difference between hot flashes and illness, especially fever given she got cold with fever, not hot.   Dysuria had been intermittent per her report. UA 12/22/21 contained calcium oxalate crystals, and neither this nor a second collection 12/23/21 contained support for infection. Had there been infection, abx for CAP would likely have offered coverage.   She discharged home 12/27/21 feeling well compared to prior (but we appreciate she had not suffered fever the morning of discharge) with plan to follow up with her Rheumatologist. A leukemia / lymphoma w/u was pending at discharge and will require follow-up Prednisone was to resume at dose prior to admission, 15 mg daily.

They monitored blood pressure, pulse, oxygen l evels for several hours. As benadryl wore off redness developed across entire back area and red welt appeared on front abdomen. Blood pressure and pulse were elevated for about 2 hours going up and down until finally staying i n normal range. ER doctor prescribed high dose of prednisone for allergic reaction. Symptoms resolved and was discharged from ER. ER did EKG and CBC W/Auto differential, comprehensive metabolic blood panel, troponin, and TSH with reflex. Results were normal TSH was 3.07 uIU/mL. Wanted to check thyroid l evel as I take l evothyroxine due to hypothyroidism 100 mg daily. 2 days l ater as steroids wore off began feeling burning sensations on skin i n different areas stomach, back, face and took benadryl for 3 days until symptoms resolved.

219,"My daughter came down with a fever for 5 days starting on Feb 19 which was 6 days after her MMR and Varicella vaccines.  According to multiple sources online her reaction was consistent to a reaction to the Measles portion of the vaccine.  She did have a minor rash. She continued with fever and not wanting to eat anything and her illness and fever progressed from there to a possible diagnosis of Mono about a week later which was based on a monospot test which according to the CDC is not very reliable in children and her Epstein Barr results were not returned or shipped to facility because of inclement weather (that's where they send bloodwork for Epstein Barr.) She got worse after the ""diagnosis"". She developed a terrible crust over her eyes that kept coming throughout the day for over about a week and her nose was terribly full of snot.  She was not eating still and I was having to give her Ensure everyday along with her fluids for 7 weeks to keep her ""fed.""  Her white count at the time of the Mono diagnosis was 23,000.  She was still not eating on her own much by the first week in April (only a bite here and there) I was continuing to talk with nurse periodically about her condition on the phone and I was continuing to keep her hydrated and give her Ensure at home. On April 9th she came down with 104 fever and we tried to treat her at home for a couple of days but there was no change so on April 11 we took her to the ER and I spent 5 hours there with her as they ran tests for everything imaginable.  Her white count was still very high (22,000) and according to the ER doc nothing was showing us the cause of the fever but he decided to treat her symptom (fever) as a bacterial infection. Later on her doctor told me that the xray report showed a tiny sign of something that could have been early Pneumonia.  I have obtained copies of most of her records related to this situation.  Nothing ever cultured out bacterially speaking but the antibiotic that she was given has seemed to help and so far as of April 20th she has been better.

Presumed pathologic fracture. There appears to be some fragment of calcium or bone in the spinal column at the T5 level. There is loss of the fat planes around the central canal and foramen at this level as well as just above and below the compressed segment. Presumed cord compression although this is not certain and MRI would be helpful better evaluate this region.  -MRI thoracic spine: Rredemonstration of a severe pathologic compression fracture of the T5 vertebral body, likely secondary to neoplastic process. As stated, there is soft tissue extending into the spinal canal from the posterior aspect of the T5 vertebral body and also from the pedicles and posterior elements of T5. As a result, there is severe cord compression at the T5 level.There is also evidence of anterior subluxation of T4 and T5 secondary to tumor infiltration of the left and right superior articulating facets of T5. Therefore I believe there is evidence of instability of the thoracic spine at the T5 4-T5 level. There is 4 mm of anterior subluxation of T4 and T5 and some focal kyphosis of the thoracic spine at the T5 level.Bulky right hilar soft tissue mass or lymphadenopathy is partially seen on the sagittal images. This is probably due to neoplastic process. Plan: -Neurosurgery consulted: They are planning to complete a T2-T8/9 decompression and instrumented fusion on 9/30 or 9/31.

Per the patient, she began to experience symptoms after she had spinal surgery done on 8/2/2021 for a fracture of her T6 vertebrae.  Since her surgery, she has felt extremely weak and fatigued, and has had minimal to no energy. She endorses progressively worsening pain near the original spinal surgical site.  She said that the pain normally radiates down and out, following along the edges of her ribs to her sternal area.  She described the pain as burning in nature and said it is very intense.  She said that the pain generally comes and goes and is usually worse with movement.  She stated that she has tried ice, heat, and was prescribed naproxen for the pain without any relief.  Her symptoms are associated with severe weakness in her legs, which she described this as having ""spaghetti legs"" and numbness of her groin area.  At this time, she denies any bladder or bowel incontinence.","Atelectasis, Haemoglobin decreased, 2 test positive, Condition aggravated, Gamma, Respiratory syncytial virus test negative, Kyphosis,

It has not done anything but stayed in the muscle occasionally; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This 81-year-old female consumer (patient) reported for herself.  An 81-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0176, Expiration date: 20Aug2021), via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 15May2021 (at the age of 81-year-old) as DOSE 2, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient medical history includes Pneumonia cryptococcal (Dormant Lung disease cryptococcus), Osteopenia, Pancreatic disorder, Crohn's disease and Colectomy (2002), Cancer, Diabetes mellitus and Polyp, aphasia and seizures (1996).  Dormant Lung disease cryptcoccus, this comes from pigeons, bats and birds poo flying in the air. With allergies the caller breathed it in on some far at the time in year 2000. Checked every year since year 2000.  Gastroenterologist after many undisclosed solution for drastic weight loss since year 2018, now several tests have determined the caller's pancreas and stomach are not cooperating with each other. The caller has many issues with what the Gastroenterologist are doing with the caller, she feels like a Guinea pig. Concomitant medications include PANCREATIN (CREON) for Pancreatic disorder, AMITRIPTYLINE for Cerebral disorder and CYANOCOBALAMIN (B12-VITAMIIN). The patient was taking concomitant products creon because stomach and pancreas not cooperating with each other. In relation back up to brain thing drug for that is Amitriptyline. Began taking probably 12 years ago, 10 years ago at least. B12 was taking for memory, began taking probably 4 years ago courtesy of all the testing the general physician had done. The caller states she was lacking in so much and will be on this for the rest of life. Amitriptyline was supposed to take 10mg pill twice a day but don't take twice a day. Caller is getting antsy about putting too many chemicals in the body. When the caller is crying again will take more amitriptyline. So far just upset about current Pfizer situation. Only member to have Crohn's disease and intestines removed. Gall bladder, caller has not gotten. Cancer, diabetes and polyps in family history.  On 15May2021, after the vaccination, the patient experienced bad side effects of excruciating pain 3.5 hours later and the pain was for some reason was in left arm. This arm pain lasted off and on for two days. It was extreme pain. It has not done anything but stayed in the muscle occasionally, and the shoulder joint was picking occasionally, on the left and the caller still had the clicking. The pain was a normal like grade of 2 to 3 type pain at the time of this report. Whenever the caller twinges the pain happens on its own. Patient also experienced wobbly ankles, knees and hips. The caller's walking was terrible, caller states this is just persisting but at a lower level. The caller is concerned because she is a fracture risk person because of osteopenia. Patient experienced blurry eyes and tiredness. The caller usually gets blurry eyes when the caller is not hydrated enough because of loss of weight and the ileostomy bag itself is free flowing so the caller's retention is not good to begin with. The caller clarifies the infectious disease doctor when the caller was reviewed in April, prior to receiving the Pfizer Covid Vaccines, knew the caller was under weight and severely effected because the caller wears an ileostomy bag due to Chron's disease and intestines being removed twice. The caller's absorption is not normal to begin with. When the doctor's office authorized the caller to get the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine in the first place it was within a 20 minute response time and nobody evidently checked the caller's chart prior to approving the caller to get this serious serious of Pfizer Covid Vaccines. Which is why the caller is so annoyed. The patient fell asleep on the couch with the radio on.  The caller woke up to her surprise not knowing that she had even gone to sleep for a God knows unknown period. The caller continued to listen to all her favorite shows on the Saturday night radio and it happened again, the caller doesn't know the time it was the caller fell asleep again, patient also states that she passed out or what the heck ever is going on with the caller's brain. Patient also experienced tiredness, she states she delivered the grocers and unloaded the groceries and was really wiped out. She also experienced impaired driving ability that on the way back from her brothers house she doesn't even remember driving away at about 21:00. She states God knows how many minutes later in the caller's driveway sitting at the steering wheel of the caller's car. The caller has no recollection of what transpired in the 12 miles from the brother's house to the caller's house. Patient also experienced blood clot coming from the nasal area on 15May2021. It was a tiny blood clot, not normal, red from end to end. A hair, two or three like hair from the head coming out of the left nostril when the caller blew her nose. Tiny, red tipped white, no pain, no drip, nothing except naturally what came out when the caller blew her nose, hardly. caller states this went away and didn't last at all. on 16May2021, the next day with pain in the arm was off and on. On 17May2021 patient called the doctor's office and listed all of her side effects and passed the message to whatever nurse on duty and the nurse consults the doctor. The caller had been told to do the report to Pfizer for anything wrong. Also, the caller went to the Urgent Care, they told the caller she could not get her B12 shot for memory.

379,"This case was reported in a published article. It was ruled in 2001 that the patient who suffered from Aicardi's syndrome, could not be said to have ""received"" the measles virus vaccine live (Enders-Edmonston) (+) mumps virus vaccine live (Jeryl Lynn) (+) rubella virus vaccine live (Wistar RA 27/3) (HSA) vaccine in utero based on the most restrictive plausible meaning of the word as required at the time by the Vaccine Act's waiver of sovereign immunity. The judge said that he held the case on abeyance in the event that agency addressed the issue, but instead, he said, the petitioners moved for reconsideration based on an intervening court decision. Under decision, the judge said, he may rule for the more persuasive definition, rather than the most limiting. Given that the Vaccine Act was a ""remedial"" statute under the decision, he said the more persuasive interpretation that the developing fetus receives a vaccine given in the mother even though it had neither ingested not been injected with it as described in the Vaccine Act. It was reported that it was concluded in 2001, that the statutory language was ambiguous in its application to this situation, and that both competing interpretations were at least ""plausible"" by the judge. Therefore, he concluded, that he was not free to choose the interpretation that he found to be more persuasive. He was bound under the cases, rather, to choose the interpretation that would produce the most narrow and restricted waiver of sovereign immunity. In light on the opinion, however, the judge stated that he was free to weigh relative merits of the two competing interpretations. Further, decision specified that he was free to consider general principles of statutory construction other than the sovereign immunity canon of narrow construction, he could take into account the statutory consideration of liberal construction of remedial statutes. The special master directed the patient's parents to determine whether they could obtain an expert report that the vaccine likely progressed through the patient's mother body into the fetus she was carrying and, if so, whether it caused the patient's seizure disorder, brain malformation and significant developmental delay. The representing parent patient's information was reported. Follow up information has been received from an an article via company representative referring to a female infant of unknown age on 20-MAR-2019. Information about medical history, concurrent condition and concomitant therapy was unknown. On 07-DEC-1995, the mother delivered her first via cesarean section. The patient's older sibling was born full-term, and no congenital abnormalities were noted. The mother became pregnant with last menstrual period (LMP) of 15-FEB-1996 and estimated date of delivery (EDD) of 21-NOV-1996. On 25-MAR-1996 in the first trimester of her pregnancy, the mother was vaccinated with M-M-R II (HSA) (dose, frequency, route, batch/lot number and expiration date were not provided) for prophylaxis. The patient experienced exposure to M-M-R II (transplacentally)(foetal exposure during pregnancy, first trimester)(It was also reported that the patient received the vaccination approximately 2 months into her second pregnancy.). On an unknown date during the pregnancy, confirmatory measurements performed by ultrasound showed the actual delivery date of a full term infant would place this immunization at approximately 26 days after conception. On 19-AUG-1996 approximately 27 weeks into her pregnancy: the mother's first prenatal visit took place. On 28-AUG-1996 and 06-NOV-1996, ultrasounds were performed, and the results were unremarkable. The mother delivered the female patient by repeat cesarean due to cephalopelvic disproportion and ineffectual induced labor. The patient's weight was seven pounds, nine ounces. The patient's scores were 8 and 9. On an unknown date upon discharge from the hospital, the patient was noted to be large for her gestational age and macrocephalic. When the patient was two days old, a neonatal sonogram was performed and showed that the patient had enlarged brain ventricles and possible associated cerebral or mid-brain abnormalities. On that same day, the patient was transferred to another hospital for evaluation of possible hydrocephalus. On an unknown date while in the second hospital, the patient received a hearing screening, a computerized tomography(CT) scan, and a cranial ultrasound. The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of hydrocephalus ex vacuo with insult occurring possibly in utero, and was noted to have had an absent corpus callosum. An eye examination revealed hypoplasia of the optic nerves with retinal hypertrophy, dysgenesis and macular sparing. Serology reports showed a normal complete blood count. The patient had positive IgG titers to rubella at 2.49(k) and herpes type 1 at 3.25(f), and negative titers to toxoplasmosis and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). On 27-NOV-1996, the patient was discharged and was scheduled to follow up with neurosurgery and ophthalmology. On 09-DEC-1996 and 29-JAN-1997, the patient was evaluated by her pediatrician and no abnormalities were noted. On 29-JAN-1997, the patient had a slightly bulging fontanel. In approximately mild March 1997, the patient began having episodes of jerking and colonic movements three times a day, followed by being tired and sleepy. On 10-APR-1997, some spells occurred when the patient turned off to the side for about a second at a time for about 15 times in row, and it was concerned that the patient was having seizures by the pediatrician. The patient had an appointment with a physician in the next week and would probably get an electroencephalogram (EEG). In early May of 1997, the patient began to have episodes of severe and prolonged jerks with eyes shifting back and forth lasting for 5-10 minutes. On 12-MAY-1997, the patient had become more severe and prolonged three to four days prior. The patient was admitted for hydrocephalus and to rule out tumor. On 12-MAY-1997, the patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast, a CT, and an EEG of her brain, which showed agenesis or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, at least one interhemispheric cyst, and compensatory dilation of both occipital horns, among other things. There was no evidence of a brain tumor. A retinal exam after dilation showed whate areas around each disc with sharp borders, consistent with the lesion seen in Aicardi syndrome(AS). On 15-MAY-1997 upon discharge from hospital, the patient was diagnosed with infantile spasms, brain malformation, bilateral otitis media, developmental delay, diaper rash, and AS.  The patient was started on phenobarbital and adrenocorticotropic hormone injection treatment, which ultimately decreased the frequency and severity of the seizures. On 01-JUL-1997, the patient had been no seizures since discharge on 05-DEC-1997. It was noted that although the anterior segment of each eye was normal, but the funduscopic examination did show characteristic fundus lesions of Aicardi's syndrome. On 07-OCT-1997, it was noted that the patient had AS and that she continued to have about 10 sets of spasm-like episodes per day. On 03-DEC-1997, the patient had responded somewhat to Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), although she still had as many as ten mild clusters a day until recently. On 06-OCT-1998, when the patient was almost two years old, the infant had a history of AICARDI syndrome and infantile spasms. The infant was cruising but was not walking independently. The infant's verbal development was a little more advanced than her gross motor skills, with perhaps 10 words, a good listening vocabulary, good social interaction, and a sense of humor"". On 11-DEC-1998, the patient was re-admitted to hospital for placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, in order to relieve intraventricular pressure. The patient was noted to be more alert and more verbal. On 12-JAN-1999 and 24-AUG-1999, the patient was again noted to have been doing well. On 10-JAN-2001, the patient was seen for a fever. The patient was recently seen at the Emergency Room(ER) for a breakthrough seizure. The patient was acute viral syndrome and AS with seizure disorder. On 15-AUG-2002, the patient was taken to hospital because she was having seizures. the patient's was prescribed an increase in phenobarbital. On 22-APR-2004, the patient had been fairly stable since her last visit. The patient was had been taking 120 mg of phenobarbital a day and 500 mg of lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) twice a day. The patient's condition further stabilized, and at a follow-up appointment on 29-JUL- 2004, the patient was having only two or three brief seizures a week. The patient was recommended decreasing her phenobarbital to 105mg a day in divided dosages. The patient returned 03-FEB-2005. The mother complained that the patient had periods of behavioral outbursts and questioned whether her shunt was working properly. During the exam, the patient was uncooperative and had poor eye contact. A CT scan was recommended, and the patient's prescribed phenobarbital dosage was decreased due to infrequent seizures (occurring only once every two weeks). The CT scan results from 07-MAR-2005 showed hydrocephalus (more pronounced on the left side) and indicated that the shunt tube may not be working. The patient was seen at a Neurology Center on 06-APR-2006. The patient's EEG results from January 2006 were described as profoundly abnormal and the patient was noted to be symptomatic of secondary generalized epilepsy syndrome. Other medical impressions were AS, West's Syndrome, Mental Retardation, Cerebral Palsy, and possible Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The patient's seizures were poorly controlled and the patient was resistant to medication. On 28-AUG-2007, the patient was prescribed an increase in her Lamictal to 200mg twice a day. On 30-APR-2008, the patient was noted to be stable and her medication was tolerated well. The working impression of the patient's condition was Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome with a history of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The patient returned to the Neurology Center on 30-SEP-2008, the patient was indicated that had a remarkable reduction in the frequency of breakthrough seizures on the medication topamax. On 15-FEB-2010, an EEG resulted in findings consistent with a diffuse underlying disturbance of neuronal function with superimposed interictal features of a secondary generalized epilepsy such as that can be seen in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. On 21-JUN-2012, the patient's diagnoses included AS and chronic seizure disorder (now only on one medication). The physician also noted that the patient was having an increasing amount of interaction with family members and more difficulty with discipline. At her follow-up visit on 16-AUG-2012, the patient was still having seizures, as well as daily partial spells. The patient was also having grand mal seizures during her menstrual period. An increase in her anticonvulsant medication, banzel, to three a day, appeared to decrease the number of generalized seizures. On 13-MAY-2013, the patient was noted to have mental retardation, AS and frequent seizures. The patient's medications included medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA) and rufinamide (BANZEL).  The outcome of foetal exposure during pregnancy, first trimester was recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown. The causality assessments between all the events and ineffectual induced labor and M-M-R II were considered as related. Upon internal review, aicardi's syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and seizure were determined to be medically significant. Literature report: Judge in favor of petitioner.
